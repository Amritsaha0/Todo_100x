# Todo Management App - Backend

## Project Overview
This is the backend for a full-stack Todo Management application, built using **Node.js, Express, and MongoDB**. The backend provides user authentication, task creation, and management functionalities. It serves as the API layer for the frontend, handling requests and interacting with the database.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Signup and authentication using a middleware for secure access.
- **Todo Management**: Users can create, update, retrieve, and mark todos as completed.
- **Data Validation**: Ensures valid input data using schema validation.
- **Middleware for Security**: Protects endpoints and ensures only authenticated users can modify their data.
- **Database Integration**: Uses MongoDB with Mongoose ORM for efficient data handling.
- **Scalable API Structure**: Designed for easy expansion and integration with a frontend.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (Mongoose ORM)
- **Authentication & Security**: Middleware-based validation
- **Other Tools**: Zod for input validation, Body-parser for request handling

## Frontend Integration
This backend is designed to work seamlessly with a React/Next.js frontend. The frontend will consume the APIs for user authentication and todo management.

## Future Enhancements
- User roles and permissions
- Enhanced error handling and logging
- Deployment to a cloud platform
